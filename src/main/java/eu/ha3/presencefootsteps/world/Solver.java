/**
 * Solves in-world locations and players into associations. Associations are an

 * the blockmap and defined with these values:<br>
 * <br>
 * The association null is derived from blockmap "NOT_EMITTER" and means the
 * block is NOT MEANT to emit sounds (not equal to "no sound").<br>
 * The association "_NO_ASSOCIATION:xx:yy:zz" is derived from AN ABSENCE of an
 * entry in the blockmap (after solving missing metadata and carpets). xx,yy,zz
 * is the location of the incremented block.<br>
 * Any other association string returned by the findAssociation* methods
 * correspond to an Acoustic name.
